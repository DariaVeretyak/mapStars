            content="Motivation technology is a proprietary development of our
            company. It is designed to increase the number of reviews and
            recommendations about your business at the expense of old customers,
            which directly affects the number of new customers.
            To implement the technology, we use carriers - motivators. They come
            in various formats: a tabletop, a signboard, a banner, a business
            card, a sticker, a product packaging element, a leaflet, and so on.
            Our task is to integrate the use of the motivator into your business
            process.
            With your help or on your own, the client, using a mobile device,
            read the QR code from the motivator and goes to a special website
            of the institution's complaint. On this page, he will be able to
            share social recommendations and leave feedback about visiting your
            establishment, thus promoting you on the network. Advertising
            messages about your establishment will be distributed on social
            networks (Facebook, Instagram) or in the form of messages via
            instant messengers (Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram).
            The introduction of technology significantly increases the number
            of reviews left on Google Maps, which subsequently increases the
            popularity and frequency of issuance in Google services. Each client
            turns into a tool to attract new visitors, our technology is a
            modern version of word of mouth for your business."
