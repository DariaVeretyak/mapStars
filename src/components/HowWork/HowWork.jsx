              Motivation technology is a proprietary development of our
              company. It is designed to increase the number of reviews
              and recommendations about your business at the expense of
              old customers, which directly affects the number of new
              customers.
            </p>
            <p className="HowWorkBlock__content">
              To implement the technology, we use carriers - motivators.
              They come in various formats: a tabletop, a signboard, a
              banner, a business card, a sticker, a product packaging
              element, a leaflet, and so on. Our task is to integrate
              the use of the motivator into your business process.
            </p>
            <p className="HowWorkBlock__content">
              With your help or on your own, the client, using a mobile
              device, read the QR code from the motivator and goes to a
              special website of the institution&apos;s complaint. On this
              page, he will be able to share social recommendations and
              leave feedback about visiting your establishment, thus
              promoting you on the network. Advertising messages about
              your establishment will be distributed on social networks
              (Facebook, Instagram) or in the form of messages via
              instant messengers (Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram).

              The introduction of technology significantly increases the
              number of reviews left on Google Maps, which subsequently
              increases the popularity and frequency of issuance in
              Google services. Each client turns into a tool to attract
              new visitors, our technology is a modern version of word
              of mouth for your business.
